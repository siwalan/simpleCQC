CQC Function for Modal Analysis

Input = Frequency, Damping, Component
Component Matrix
The component that wants to be calculated ....
Row = DOF component; Columns = Mode
Frequency Matrix
Can either be column or row oriented, the first mode frequency should can be accessed using frequency(1), the second mode  should can be accessed using frequency(2)
Damping
Same concept applies from Frequency Matrix
